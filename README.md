# Smart-Home-System-Programming-Exercise-

Problem Statement
Create a simulation for a Smart Home System that allows the user to control different smart devices such as lights, thermostats, and door
locks via a central hub. The user should be able to set schedules, automate tasks, and view the status of each device.

Functional Requirements

1. Initialize the Smart Home System with different devices, each having their own unique ID and type (light, thermostat, door lock).
2. Implement features to:
Turn devices on/off
Schedule devices to turn on/off at a particular time
Automate tasks based on triggers (e.g., turning off lights when the thermostat reaches a certain temperature)
3. Optional: Provide the ability to add or remove devices dynamically.
